### Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition
# Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning system that can automatically recognize handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to automate tasks such as reading postal codes, bank checks, and forms, thereby reducing manual effort.
# Approach
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model, is used for high accuracy in image recognition. The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
# Key Features
Automatic Recognition: The system can automatically identify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
High Accuracy: The model achieves approximately 94% accuracy.
Real-world Applications: Helps in automating tasks like reading postal codes, bank checks, and forms.
# How It Works
The CNN learns to identify patterns, such as edges and shapes, within the digit images to accurately classify them. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and testing to create a reliable digit recognition tool.
